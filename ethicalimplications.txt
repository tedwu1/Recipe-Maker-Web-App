As developers of this Food Recipe Web Application, it is our ethical and professional responsibility to create a website that is safe, 
inclusive, and responsible. We will uphold the protection of our users' personal information, such as emails and passwords.
 We will use secure password hashing and the HTTPS protocol to protect our users' information. We will also make our website 
 user-friendly for people of many backgrounds and abilities, as we will ensure that our website has the proper contrast and 
 readable fonts. Users will also have control over their content, in which they can edit or delete their own recipes and information,
 and their data will never be used for any malicious purposes. We highly discourage users from plagiarizing any content and 
 encourage them to credit any sources for recipes. We will moderate any comments or recipes that contain harassment, hate speech,
  or misinformation.
